# Coin changer kata

# Write a function that takes a number of cents, and that returns a hash
# containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents.

# eg. If you have 11 cents you should return
#   {:dime => 1, :penny => 1};
# eg. If you have 31 cents you should return
#  {:quarter => 1, :nickel => 1, :penny => 1};
# eg. If you have 93 cents {:quarter => 3, :dime => 1, nickel => 1, :penny => 3}

# Start a new repo
# Build up your coin_changer using tests

# Just use Sinatra to input a number
# Then return the hash with how many coins you need


# 1) Write test first - commit to git after every test
# 2) Write function, verify test(s) passing - commit to git
# 3) Once function done, setup in Sinatra

#---------------------------------------------------

#use sinatra to allow user to input a number
#use hash to handle conversion:

money = {
	quarters: 25,
	dimes: 10,
	nickels: 5,
	pennies: 1
}

# input a number (more than a dollar is fine)
# - ex: 38.67
# return a hash of how many bills/coins for each:
# - one $20, one $10, one $5, three $1, two quarters, one dime, one nick, two pennies
