Home work for Wed is to carry on with your sinatra isbn app. Make sure  you are able to input an isbn number and return if it is a good number or not.  Then have the choice to check another.  In order for this to work correctly your valid isbn function needs to work properly.  Once this is complete feel free to refactor another project and start looking into hashes as we will be working with them next class.
