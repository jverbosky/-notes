For the home work we are going to re do one or more of previous projects.  So first make a new repo and add a Readme.  Please commit  often so that we can see that you understand what you are working on..  If you work in teams then add your team mates  to your commit message but be sure that everyone has there own code base and fully understands what every line of code does.  Please feel free to reach out to others and work in groups.
