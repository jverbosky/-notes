@chameis123 @dover @edwinwells @lisatechhirestudent I did some research this weekend on iOS push notifications and thought this might be helpful for you guys as well.  For the messaging server, we're going to use Google Firebase. Jen and Aaron (Mined Minds developers) have been using it as well, FWIW.
