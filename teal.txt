Management approach

----------------------

Project Description
Technical Architecture
Financials
Client Particulars

----------------------

Project Teams

----------------------

2-person is a guideline
- can potentially add a 3rd person

Skills inventory so clear who knows what

Team member availability
- Team board for the standup board (global view)
- Trello board for each project

----------------------

Outside of projects, there are other things to deal with

----------------------

Trying to get away from asking Amanda and Jonathan: "what should I do next?"
- Look at open projects and required skills, find a good fit
