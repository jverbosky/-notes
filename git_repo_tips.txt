JV notes:

git config --get remote.origin.url
# Lists the origin associated with the current directory

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jverbosky/sonicpi_examples.git
# Used to change origin URL after renaming directory

git push origin master --force
# Used after getting error message following directory rename:
#
# PS F:\Documents\Dropbox\MindedMinds\sonic_pi_examples> git push origin master
# To https://github.com/jverbosky/sonicpi_examples.git
# ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
# error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jverbosky/sonicpi_examples.git'
# hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
# hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
# hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
# hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
